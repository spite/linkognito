# why?
Mainly because I find myself more and more opening in incognito mode links from sites that I know that collect and track information. It doesn't have to be about privacy and cyber-paranoia, it's enough to open a "[Demographic] reacts to something" linked somewhere, and YouTube suddenly thinks you need to see EVERY video ever created related to that. In theory, it's a way of bypassing the recomendation engines, and more.
